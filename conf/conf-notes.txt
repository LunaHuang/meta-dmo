To build a image with the vivante gpu driver you need to accept the FSL EULA.
You can find the EULA in meta-fsl-arm layer in the EULA - textfile.

To agree this you have to need to add a 

	ACCEPT_FSL_EULA = "1"

in your conf/local.conf.


following command builds the image

	* dmo-image

depending on the selected distro configuration, the image will contain
different preinstalled software.
There are currently three different distro configurations
	
	* dmo-distro
	* dmo-distro-qt 
	* dmo-distro-x11

In the "dmo-distro" is the minimal configuration.
The "dmo-distro-qt" is a qt5 only distro, where x11 is disabled.
And the "dmo-distro-x11" is a full image, containing x11 and qt5.

The "dmo-distro-x11" is set as default, to use the "dmo-distro-qt" you have to
change the DISTRO parameter in your conf/local.conf.
