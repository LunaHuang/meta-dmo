There are two machine setups to choose from:
	* dmo-edm-comb-bw6 for broadwell
	* dmo-edm-comb-bs6 for braswell 

Following command builds the image

	* dmo-image

Depending on the selected distro configuration, the image will contain
different preinstalled software.
There are currently three different distro configurations
	
	* dmo-distro
	* dmo-distro-qt 
	* dmo-distro-x11

In the "dmo-distro" is the minimal configuration.
The "dmo-distro-qt" is a qt5 only distro, where x11 is disabled.
And the "dmo-distro-x11" is a full image, containing x11 and qt5.

The "dmo-distro-x11" is set as default, to use the "dmo-distro-qt" you have to
change the DISTRO parameter in your conf/local.conf.
