To build a image with the vivante gpu driver you need to accept the FSL EULA.
You can find the EULA in meta-fsl-arm layer in the EULA - textfile.

To agree this you have to need to add a 

	ACCEPT_FSL_EULA = "1"

in your conf/local.conf.



meta-dmo has currently two image-recipies

	* dmo-image-release
	* dmo-image-minimal
