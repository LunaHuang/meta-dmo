To build a image with the vivante gpu driver you need to accept the FSL EULA.
You can find the EULA in meta-fsl-arm layer in the EULA - textfile.

To agree this you have to need to add a 

	ACCEPT_FSL_EULA = "1"

in your conf/local.conf.



meta-dmo has currently two image-recipies

	* dmo-image-minimal
	* dmo-image-release

and two distro configurations
	
	* poky-dmo-x11
	* poky-dmo-qt 

The "poky-dmo-qt" is a qt5 only distro, where x11 is disabled.

The "poky-dmo-x11" is set as default, to use the "poky-dmo-qt" you have to
change the DISTRO parameter in your conf/local.conf.
